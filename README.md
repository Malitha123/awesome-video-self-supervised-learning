# <p align=center>`Self-Supervised Learning in Videos`</p>

This repository contains a collection of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches for various downstream tasks, such as action recognition, video retrieval, etc. With the exponential growth of video data, there is an increasing need for automatic video analysis methods that can learn from large amounts of unlabelled data. Self-supervised learning provides an effective solution to this problem by allowing models to learn from the data itself without explicit supervision.

In this repository, we have gathered some of the most promising self-supervised learning approaches for video analysis and organized them based on their publication year. Whether you are new to self-supervised learning in videos or an experienced researcher in the field, we hope that this repository will serve as a valuable resource for exploring the latest advances in this exciting area of research.
